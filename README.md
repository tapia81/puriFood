## Description

- **What is PuriFood**: PuriFood is a tool that allows a health conscious
  person to find & share healthy recipes. Users can save
  their favorite recipes, while also creating their own.
  They can view the receipe's & the ingredient's
  nutritional facts. They will be able to search for
  receipes not just by recipe type but by filtering for
  specific food.
- **MVP**: PuriFood users will be able to create their own
  recipes and store them onto their MongoDB database.
  Once created, the user will be able to delete and
  update their recipes.
- **Post MVP**: PuriFood Users will be able to save recipes
  from the EDAMAM API into their database. A user will
  be able find similar recipes based on categories,
  country of origin, or ingredients. For the mobile
  version, they will be able to add ingredients from
  the recipes into a shopping list.
